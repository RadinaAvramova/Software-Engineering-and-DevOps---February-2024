Summary

Software engineering provides knowledge, processes, practices and tools for all the phases in software development lifecycle (SDLC)

Software requirements describe the functionalities of the software

Software design and architecture describe system structure â€“ modules and interactions

Software constructions involves coding, debugging, unit testing,code reviews and integration (including CI)

The QA engineering process ensures the software works as intended, mostly through testing (manual and automated)

Software deployment ships the software to customers and goes through different deployment environments
